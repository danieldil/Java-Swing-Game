# Java-Swing-Game
2d puzzle game created with Java Swing, Java Graphics, Java, and Voce. 
The player can move using the up, down, left, right arrow keys. 
I used java swing and voce to create this game. 
Voce can be found here: voce.sourceforge.net
Voce is a speech synthesis and recognition library that is cross-platform, accessible from Java and C++, and has a very small API. 
It uses CMU Sphinx4 and FreeTTS internally.
